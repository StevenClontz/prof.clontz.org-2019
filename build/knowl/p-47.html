<p>Each project has several due dates; the instructor will give feedback as soon as possible after each due date. All students who donâ€™t receive mastery credit on a due date for whatever reason may submit for grading on the next due date. After (usually) three due dates, students must meet with the instructor during office hours to discuss further submissions, or submit a final revision at the final exam.</p>
